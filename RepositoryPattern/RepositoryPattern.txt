was first driven as a part of domain driven design in 2004

it provides an abstraction of data

it helps to provide loose coupling
benefit is to minimize duplication of logic

lets understand with the help of an example

let say you have requirement to display list of candidate

traditional approach: _db.Category.Select(i => new SelectListItem(){Text = i.Name, Value = i.Id.toString()})

repository approach

var categorySelectList = _repository.GetCategoryListForDropDown();

2. it decouples your application from persistance framework

in future if you decide to change, you can do with minimal impact on your app
